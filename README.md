# ClocViewer
This project is a simple GUI around [cloc](https://github.com/AlDanial/cloc).

## Usage
The following settings are available:
- Source Path: The folder you want to analyze.
- Cloc Path: The path to your cloc.exe.
- OptionsFile Path [Optional]: The path to a file that contains additional options passed to cloc.
- IgnoredFile Path [Optional]: The path where the path and infos to ignored files will be stored.

You can save and load these settings in a file via the menu.

Run the analysis and wait for the result. You should then be able to view the result in the grid and you can browse it.

You can also select one or more entries in the grid and you see the summary in the status bar and also a list of all used languages in the grid on the right side.
